ANNOUNCEMENT
============

Unfortunately my computer has died and due to a lack of continous employment over the recent months I am currently unable to purchase a replacement machine at this point.

I will therefore no longer be developing this software until I am able to purchase a replacement.

It is always a little rude to ask for donations, but as I am developing this software free of charge for everyone to use. I will therefore be accepting donations towards the purchase of a new machine.

Okay, I'll also take [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=G2M23XDAB8HBA)

This project has two dependencies:

1. the BouncyCastle Crypto library.
2. ThoughtWorks QRCode DLL

Get BouncyCastle from http://www.bouncycastle.org/csharp/  (just the compiled assembly is fine).
